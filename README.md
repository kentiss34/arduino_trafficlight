# arduino_trafficlight
Arduino project to control a traffic light with a Bluetooth  app.

REQUIREMENT 
======
* A 3 lights traffic light
* Arduino Uno
* A 3 channels relay board at least
* A bluetooth shield (HC-05 is perfect)
* Some wires to connect everything together
* An Android phone

INSTALL
======
* Link the Arduino to the relay board (on the pin 8/9/10 by default), and wire the traffic light on the power side (I won't show the schema, because you should know what you do (HIGH VOLTAGE ! so this is very dangerous)).
* Link the bluetooth shield board on pin 6 for RX and pin 7 for TX.
* Push the sketch main.v2.c to the Arduino (with an Arduino IDE)
* Download the app trafficlight.apk

WARNING
======
I am not reponsible in case of troubles with your installation, check everything before powering it. Don't touch the components when they're on power.
Enjoy !
